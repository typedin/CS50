0.  How many different colors does each format support?
	
	BMP: 16 million colors, GIF: 256 colors, JPEG: 16 million colors, PNG: 16 million colors

1.  Which format supports animation?
	
	GIF
	
2.  What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
	
	Lossless compression provides a way to compress the file (to gain storage space) without altering the quality of the image.
    On the other hand, the lossy compression reduces the size by eliminating some data
    
3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
	
	JPEG 
	
4.  What happens when a file is deleted from a FAT file system?
	
	First, the system modifies the filename’s first character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
    Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. The actual file data remains intact.
    
5. What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?  
	
	The software way: if the disk drive is functionning properly, fill the entire disk with ASCII NUL bytes
    The hardware way: destroy the disk itself 
    
6.  What is stdint.h?
	
	It's a header that declares a set of integer types. Those have specified widths (number of bits used to store values) and specified limits.
	
7.  What's the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
	
	Using them ensure the code will always behave the same way depending on the architecture. They are "aliases" to whatever integer type 
	
8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
	(assume 32-bit architecture like the cs50 appliance).
	
	BYTE: 1
	DWORD: 4
	LONG: 4
	WORD: 2
	
9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
	(Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called
	"magic numbers").

	ASCII: BM	
	decimal: 16973
	hexadecimal: 424D

10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
	
	bfSize corresponds the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
	(cf. : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd183374%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)

	biSize corresponds to the number of bytes required by the structure.
	(cf. : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd183376%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)


11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
	
	If biHeight is negative, it indicates a top-down DIB.
	In a top-down DIB, the image buffer starts with the first row in memory, followed by the next row down. Compared to bottom-ip DIB, the order of the rows is reversed.
	It's equivalent to how western languages are written. 
	
12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
	
	The filed "biBitCount" in the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure specifies the color depth.
	(cf. : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd183376%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)

13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
	
	If the program cannot open the file (or create a pointer to a file), the pointer will be set to NULL. For example : the folder's permissions don't allow the user to write anything, a parsing error on third command line argument occured, etc. 

14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
	
	Because the code needs to read in 1 element at a time (one nmemb)
	
15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
	
	(4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4
	bi.biWidth is 3
	sizeof(RGBTRIPLE) is 3 (3 * sizeof(BYTE) = 3)
	(4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4 = 3
	It assigns 3.
	
16. What does fseek do?
	
	This function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to.
	
17. What is SEEK_CUR?
	
	It's the current file position indicator's position
